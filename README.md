# Solidity Contract Compilation and Deployment with Ganache

This README provides step-by-step instructions to compile and deploy a Solidity smart contract using Ganache, a personal Ethereum blockchain for development purposes and play.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- Ganache: [Download Ganache](https://www.trufflesuite.com/ganache)
- Node.js: [Download Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- Truffle: Install globally using npm:
`npm install -g truffle`

## compile and deploy the contract
- clone the repo:
    `git clone <link to this repo>`
- enter in the project folder
    `cd BattleshipR-M`
- complile the smart contract with Truffle:
    `truffle compile`
- deploy the contract
    `truffle deploy`
## run the application
